# **Mysterious Organism**

This program creates new objects containing random DNA sequences using a function factory. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my problem-solving skills and my knowledge with JavaScript objects.

## Project Prompt

Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6

## Setup

To run this program, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or any other ways to see output of [main.js](main.js) to the console.

- To create a new object containing a random DNA sequence and other methods and properties, use the pAequorFactory() function with a number and a function as its arguments.
