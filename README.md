# **Mysterious Organism**

This program checks if a credit card number is valid or not, as well as convert invalid credit card numbers to valid ones. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my problem-solving skills and my knowledge with JavaScript loops.

## Project Prompt

Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6

## Setup

To run this program, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or any other ways to see output of [main.js](main.js) to the console.

- To check if a credit card number is valid, use the validateCred() function and enter a string, a number or an array of numbers as its argument.
- To get an array of invalid card numbers among an array of random card numbers, use the findInvalidCards() function and enter an array of cards as its argument.
- To identify the credit card companies that supposedly issued the cards, use the idInvalidCardCompanies() function and enter an array of invalid cards as its argument.
- To convert invalid credit card numbers, use the testConversion() function and enter a string, a number or an array of numbers as its argument.
